Here’s a crisp, backlog-ready spec that keeps every detail intact.

# Global safeguard

* **NOTE:** Do not break anything while building. Do a thorough read of the project before touching anything.

# Goal

Launch a WhatsApp campaign with language selection + website CTA, then a menu → forms/next steps as specified. Create message templates accordingly.

# Flow (high level)

   * **Buttons (3):**

     1. **Hindi**
     2. **English**
     3. **Visit Website** (opens `https://sunshinepower.net.in/`)
2. **Language chosen → Main Menu (in selected language)**

   1. To book site survey → (same Site-Survey Form as above)
   2. Request a callback → simple callback capture (name, mobile)
   3. Any other help → go to Help sub-menu (below)
5. **If “Any other help” → Help sub-menu (3)**

   1. **Maintenance less service request** → Service Form:

      * Full name
